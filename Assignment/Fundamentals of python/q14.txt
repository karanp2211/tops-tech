# What are negative indexes and why are they used? 

=> Retrieving the last element (using -1).
=> Accessing elements in reverse order.
=> Extracting a sliding window of elements from the end.


# For example:

=> my_list[-1] gives the last element.
=> my_string[-3:] extracts a substring from the end of a string.
=> Negative indexes make code concise and expressive!
