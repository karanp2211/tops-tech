# How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?

""" In Python, there are three basic types of functions : 

1. Built-in Functions: These are standard functions provided by Python, such as `print()`, `len()`, and `type()`.

2. User-defined Functions: These are functions that you create yourself to perform specific tasks.
                           You define them using the `def` keyword.

3. Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions): These are small, unnamed functions defined using the `lambda` keyword.
                                           They are typically used for short, simple operations¹².   """
