# What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

Tuple: 
      => A tuple in Python is an ordered collection of elements, similar to a list.
      => However, unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created,
        its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.
      => Tuples are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses ().  

Feature	              List	                                  Tuple
Syntax	      => my_list = [1, 2, 3]	             => my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
Mutability	  => Mutable (can be modified)	         => Immutable (cannot be modified)
Methods	      => Many built-in methods	             => Fewer built-in methods
Performance   => Slower due to mutability	         => Faster due to immutability
Use Cases	  => Suitable for dynamic data	         => Suitable for static data
