Differentiate between append () and extend () methods? 

1. append():

=> Adds its argument as a single element to the end of the list.
=> The length of the list increases by one.

Example :-

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append([4, 5])
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]

2. extend():

=> Iterates over its argument and adds each element to the list.
=> The length of the list increases by however many elements were in the iterable.

Example :-

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.extend([4, 5])
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
