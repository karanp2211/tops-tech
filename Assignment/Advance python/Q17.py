# When is the finally block executed? 


"""The finally block in Python always executes, whether there was an exception or not.
   Itâ€™s like the janitor who cleans up after both success and chaos."""

# Example :

def divide(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Oops! You tried to divide by zero.")
    finally:
        print("Cleaning up...")

divide(10, 2)  # No exception
divide(10, 0)  # ZeroDivisionError
