#  What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed? 

"""=> "1" is a string literal.
   => It’s a sequence of characters, not a numeric value.
   => 1 (without quotes) is an integer."""


'''=> Python evaluates the expression by comparing the values.

   => Since they have different types (string vs. integer), they are not equal.

   => The result of "1" == 1 is False.

In other words, the string "1" is not numerically equal to the integer 1.
They might look similar, but they’re fundamentally different creatures in Python’s eyes!

Remember, when comparing values, ensure they’re of the same type for meaningful results. """'''
