#  What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology? 

'''Instantiation refers to the process of creating an instance of a class.

=> When you instantiate a class, you create an object (also known as an instance) based on that class.
=> In simpler terms, instantiation means bringing a class to life by creating an actual object that embodies
   the classâ€™s properties and behaviors.      '''


'''Class: A blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.

Object (Instance): A specific realization of a class. It has its own unique data and can perform actions defined by the class.
