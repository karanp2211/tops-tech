#  What relationship is appropriate for Student and Person? 

'''
Inheritance: A student is-a person.     
          => A “Person” could be the noble ancestor, and both “Student” and other subclasses inherit from this esteemed lineage.

Association: A student interacts with a person.
          => It’s a “uses-a” relationship. 

Aggregation: The group hug. A student aggregates “Person” instances.
          => It’s like saying, “Hey, students, gather 'round! You’re all part of the same social circle.” 

Composition: The inseparable duo. If the student exists, the associated person exists too.
          => They’re inseparable dance partners.
          => For example, a student and their address form a composition: no student without an address!    '''
